Introduction

You know all of those code screenshots you see on Twitter? Though the code's usually impressive, we saw room for improvement in the aesthetic department. Carbon makes it easy to create and share beautiful images of your source code. So what are you waiting for? Go impress all of your followers with your newfound design prowess.

Carbon example

Features

Customization. Customize things like your image's syntax theme, font style, and more
Share quickly. Save your image or a link with one click
Save snippets. Create an account to save snippets for later. Shared snippets are automatically unfurled on Twitter and Slack.
Usage

Import

There are a few different ways to import code into Carbon:

Drop a file onto the editor
Append a GitHub gist ID to the URL (e.g. carbon.now.sh/<gist_id_goes_here>)
Or just start typing!
Customization

Once you've got all of your code into Carbon, you can customize your image by changing the syntax theme, background color, window theme, padding, shadows, fonts, and more.

Exporting & Sharing

After you've customized your image you can share your snippet in a number of ways

Create a saved snippet

Sharing a saved snippet will automatically unfurl the image on platforms like Twitter and Slack. This lets users see your creation, while also giving them access to the source code via the link. Better yet, if you need to make an update, simply follow the link yourself to edit the snippet directly.

To create a saved snippet:

Login using the "Sign in/Sign up" button
Edit as you normally would — your snippet will get saved automatically
Copy the URL from your browser window and share away!
Embed a snippet

This is the recommended method for sharing Carbon on your own website or blog. Readers can even copy the code with the click of a button.

You can embed any Carbon snippet in your website directly using the carbon.now.sh/embed URL. The "Copy Menu" lets you quickly copy the correct iFrame snippet, or the encoded URL for embedding on platforms like Medium.

Finally, you can also embed saved snippets or GitHub gists using carbon.now.sh/embed/:id.

Use the Tweet button

The Tweet button will not only share the image on Twitter, but it will also correctly encode the alt text to ensure your images are accessible. However, if you want to tweet image yourself, please check out how to make your Twitter images accessible.

Download the image directly

Carbon supports downloading your image as a PNG and SVG. You can also click Export → Open to open your image directly in the browser. Finally, you can copy the Carbon image directly to your clipboard by going to Copy → Image.

Installing Carbon for Desktop (Offline)

If you are using Google Chrome, or another browser that supports Progressive Web Apps, you can install Carbon for use offline by:

Visit carbon.now.sh
